##Oil and Development

Everything that is precious to the Achuar is under imminent threat from oil drilling and exploration in their ancestral territory by Canadian company Talisman Energy.

The Achuar have made clear their opposition to this concession and have not allowed the companies to start any activities on their land. Despite this the Peruvian State still does not recognise the Achuar’s decision and continues to offer this, and other new, neighbouring blocks, to interested companies.

The creation of Block 64 is part of an ongoing State project to open up the Amazon basin to petrol exploitation. In 2007, 70% of the Peruvian Amazon was overlapped with petrol blocks, in many cases without the consultation or consent of the local indigenous population, whose lives are likely to be changed irrevocably by such operations. These actions contravene ILO Convention 169 and the UN Declaration of Indigenous Rights, of which Peru is a signatory. 

The Achuar of the Pastaza’s resistance to petrol developments comes from their desire to protect the environment on which their lifestyle and identities depend. They are determined not allow a repetition of the tragedy which has befallen the land of their relatives, the Achuar of the river Corrientes, where the rivers and forests have been polluted and the local ecosystem destroyed by almost forty years of petrol operations. Given that their existence depends entirely upon the water, flora and fauna, any damage to these will inevitably have serious implications on their own wellbeing.

They are particularly worried about the health of their children. Clinical tests carried out by the Ministry of Health have shown that most of the children living in the petrol affected areas of Corrientes have dangerously high concentrations of lead in their blood.
